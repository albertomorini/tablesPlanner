# Tables Planner is a tool to draw the map of the tables of a restaurant

## Usage:
buttons: add a table or add a waiter.
* you need to save the configuration after drag a table/waiter!
* double click to rename a table and set the seats number

## Dependencies:
- An internet connection to get Bootstrap/JQuery library.

## Problems:
With chromium (chrome etc) doesn't work properly, because chromium doesn't set cookie with "file://" protocol (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6232331/setting-cookies-using-javascript-in-a-local-html-file)

I'll work on it, but I strongly suggest to drop all chromium browser and use firefox/safari/TOR (thus to get a better privacy and better performance)
